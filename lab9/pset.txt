Complex.cpp

     add a couple of your own operators to the complex class, and modify main to test them

collection.cpp

   1)  add a bulk insertion operation to class collecton which will merge another collection into it

    2)  add >> operator to class collection to fetch elements from it (last in first out)

For the rest of the programs, observe their behavior one by one,

 make some changes to them, compute the output before you run the programs,

  and verify if you get it right.  Write about your changes and reasons for what you observe. 



you are welcome to add your own programs keeping in mind the focus of this lab:

Takeaways:       different kinds of expressions, operators, user defined operators, cascading/nesting of expressions/operators, associativity, precedence, parameter evaluation order.





what to submit: your changed programs and observations.txt. Don't submit the given programs.

submit it as one single zipped file



revisit after an hour for  some more programs.
