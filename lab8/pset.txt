Today you will learn to use assertions to trap errors while developing cod

Given bad code,

you have to:

either work with faulty code given for a function, or if the function is empty,

write your own faulty logic in it and then....

(1) write main which will expose errors (badness in code)==> segmentation fault,

core dump.

(2) design assertions which will catch all errors in the program.

    ==> error in main disappears, and assertion fails instead!



submit observations along with modified code with assertions



There is one optional problem uploaded. Also.

if you have time left after doing these programs, you can take one of your

own programs in c++ and add relevant asserts in a couple of member functions.



Experiment with assert and have fun!
