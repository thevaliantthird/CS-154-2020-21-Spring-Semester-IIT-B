Write the following two programs in plain C and using *class* construct in C++.

sample programs in each of the two language are attached. use them as starting point.

We will start comparing and differentiating bewteeen
the "procedural" and "object oriented" paradigms through this lab.
Write your observations as to what you feel about your two designs in a file called
Observations.txt

what to submit: (5 files)
program1.c  program1.cpp
program2.c  program2.cpp
Observations.txt

program1:  A program that counts the probability of
every possibility of throwing a 6 faced dice, N times.[use random number generator]
Take N as command line parameter to your program

program2: A program that reads a text file, whose name is supplied as command line parameter,
and it prints the frequency of counts of every single letter/character appearing in that file.


In C version, you are not allowed to use any object oriented feature. Use only procedures and parameters.
In C++ version, you must use class construct and member functions.

See sample.c and sample.cpp for sample code in both languages.

submit whatever you can do till 5pm in moodle submission link.
