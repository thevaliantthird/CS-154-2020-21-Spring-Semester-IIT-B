main.py

In My first encounter with functional programming, I tried to have as many functions
and as less variable as possible, and managed to reduce it to a single variable
which was word_count {} [Inside the reader() function around line 8].

The Main cascade of functional calls is seen at line 22.

I modified the first program to be even more functional but with terrible readability when sir said that the goal was to have as
less lines as possible. This wasn't very efficient though.
