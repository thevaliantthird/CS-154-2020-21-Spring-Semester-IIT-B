we will do functions and higher order functions.

But before we do that we need to do some preliminaries in python

These are the programs that I showed in class. We will do them first.

and then I will show you the next set of programs





after which a statement will be given for your exercises



problem statements:

1)  Write a program that prints unique words appearing in a text file

with their frequency of occurance

using features disussed + file demo

in python

 --sets, membership "in", loops with element accesses,

   etc.

 -- try to avoid use of variables as much as possible





for example:

if the text file contains



  hello

hellow how are

you



the program prints



hello 2

how 1

are 1

you 1
