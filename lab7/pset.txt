Take home lab:  no monitored lab session-- do it on your own



From what you have typed out for our labs, 

submit any of your bad code and its better version

what to submit:

1) Bad code cpp

2) It;s better version cpp

3) observations.txt  -- what's the change? how did you make it better?



If you have it ready, submit it, else take one of your badly written programs in this lab and modify it to make it better in terms of structuring
