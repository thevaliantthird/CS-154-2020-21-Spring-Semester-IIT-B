I developed four variants for the same program of stack in lecture today.
That code is in this folder (model 1 to 4).

1) Complete all of them model_1.cpp to model_4.cpp.
(may take about an hr)

2) Then take any two abstractions from the program  templates  given, and implement them, and then test them by using them in main

What to watch out for:

Main == user of abstraction  or it is the code that tests the abstraction

See today's video once again if you missed the descriptions of these four models.

I will also be available besides the TAs.

I will be in general thread.

Submit:
your programs, and Observations.txt to contain your design thinking and observations about the programs that you did..
